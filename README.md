# Briefs Client

This application allows our internal team members to document insights learned on the job or through personal explanations

## Getting Started

To get started with the client please for and clone this repo. From there you can go to config.js and set up a link to a local host or a deployed site and beginning editing or interacting with the application one you go through the proper deploy/set up steps

### Development Process
The development process went smoothly, spending Day 1 of the project sprint planning out the application.  From there I uploaded all of my user stories to Trello and leveraged that as my Roadmap for the dev process. The application differs from the initial design and goal of I what I plan for it to be due to project scope, I was still able to build the base of the internal tool to be leveraged within my company.  I utilized my initial sketches/wireframes to determine layout, varying slightly from those designs to insure the project scope requirements were met. Big thing with the design was simplicity, which I believe I kept throughout the application. One area that monopolized a significant amount of time was incorporating the edit button handlebars into the application.  Seeing my development from the first application I built to this one is incredible and I feel extremely comfortable developing in Rails.  I wanted to use Ember for this however, I decided against it as my general notion of front-end frameworks is that they should speed up development and I did not believe that would be the case for this project. There were times throughout that I got side-tracked on some css and making sure everything aligned, as well as getting my auth forms to clear since they weren't standard bootstrap forms. This is an application that I will use as foundation for future iterations and hope to use it internally for my company

## Unsolved Issues/Future Iterations

* Cleaner handlebars list layout
* Add categories through tags (join table with many to many relationship) and have list of categories to filter by
* Build out comment functionality
* Allow every to see all briefs and revise them, while additionally having revision history tracked and readily available.
